## Overview
**Hash Stash** is an innovative decentralized file storage solution built on Hedera's groundbreaking hashgraph technology. It offers a secure, transparent, and censorship-resistant platform for managing your files. With Hash Stash, you can take full control of your data while leveraging the power of next-gen distributed ledger technology! 🌐🔒

## Key Features
- **Secure File Storage**: Harnesses the power of Hedera's hashgraph to ensure the highest level of file integrity and protection. 🛡️
- **Transparent File Activity**: Provides a tamper-proof audit trail for all file-related actions, ensuring complete transparency. 🔍
- **Censorship Resistance**: Our decentralized architecture ensures that no single entity can restrict access to your files. 🚫

## How It Works
Hash Stash integrates Hedera's hashgraph, a next-generation distributed ledger technology that offers faster, more secure, and more efficient transactions compared to traditional blockchains. By building on Hedera, Hash Stash delivers the following benefits:

- **Scalability**: Hedera's hashgraph can handle a high volume of transactions without compromising performance. 📈
- **Security**: The decentralized nature of the hashgraph and its advanced cryptographic algorithms protect your files from unauthorized access or tampering. 🔐
- **Transparency**: All file-related activities are recorded on the hashgraph, providing a tamper-proof audit trail. 📜
- **Censorship Resistance**: The decentralized architecture of the hashgraph makes it virtually impossible for any single entity to censor or restrict access to your files. 🚀
